## About Me

I am currently working as a full-time research assistant in [MCTLab](https://sites.google.com/view/mctl) which is directed by [Dr. Li Su](https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/lisu/contact_en.html) at Academia Sinica in Taiwan. 

I earned my master's degree in Electrical Engineering major at National Taiwan University. My research interests include machine learning, Music Information Retrieval (MIR), signal processing and music generation.
