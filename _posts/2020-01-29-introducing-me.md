## About Me

I am currently working as a full-time research assistant in [MCTLab](https://sites.google.com/view/mctl){:target="_blank"} which is directed by [Dr. Li Su](https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/lisu/contact_en.html){:target="_blank"}. 

My main research interests include machine learning, Music Information Retrieval (MIR) and music signal processing.

You can find more information about my previous works [here](https://sma1033.github.io/site/01_projects/).
